## Setup
To set up the dependencies switch to the directory you cloned and run:
``` bash
npm install
```

Once the installation has completed provision the files:
``` bash
npm start
```
This will create the folder ```./paul.zuehlcke.de/dist``` which contains
 a bundled and transpiled (from es6 to es5) version of the js files from ```./paul.zuehlcke.de/js```.
